My Emacs dotfile.

* Notes
- Private/local configurations can be kept in ~custom.el~
- These settings are not tested in Windows
- My normal workflow is through the GUI (in OSX). I used to remap Meta to Cmd, but sometimes I open emacs in a terminal and this makes everything confusing.


* External dependencies
- I use ~Ipython~ as my python console
- ~eimp~ uses ~imagemagick~ to display images in dired


* Next Steps
- Settle on a proper way of handling bibliography notes in org-mode (maybe implement some functions)
- Investigate [[https://github.com/zk-phi/phi-search][phi-search]]
- Drag-and-drop files in dired on OSX.
- Learn to use [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]
- Add and test [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][Helm]]
